1. **PallasGNN: Curriculum-Driven Pattern Mining for Robust Graph Neural Networks.** *Kaiwen Xia*, Huijun Wu, Mei Xie, et al. [[arXiv](https://arXiv.org/abs/2410.12425)]  
   We propose a curriculum-driven defense that guides structure learning from easy → hard, improving robustness on non-Euclidean graphs under adversarial perturbations.

2. **Surveying The Value Alignment Cycle in LLMs: Representation, Intervention, Evaluation, and Impacts.** Tianle Gu, *Kaiwen Xia*, Lingyu Li, et al. *(Under Review)*. Work conducted at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/).

3. **A homotopy method for the constrained inverse problem in the multiphase porous media flow.** Tao Liu, *Kaiwen Xia*, Yuanjin Zheng, et al., *Processes*, 2022, 10(6):1143. [[Link](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/6/1143)]

4. **A Recommender System for Healthy Food Choices Based on Integer Programming.** Shuai Wang, *Kaiwen Xia*, Yanxiong Yang, et al., *Applied Mathematics, Modeling and Computer Simulation*. IOS Press, 2022:469–475.
