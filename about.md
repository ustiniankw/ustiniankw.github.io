I’m **Kaiwen Xia (夏凯文)**. My research focuses on **robust graph neural networks** and **trustworthy (multi-modal) large language models**, including **LLM-for-Graph** learning.

- **M.Eng.**, Computer Science and Technology, **NUDT**, 2023–2026  
- **B.Eng.**, Data Science, **Northeastern University (China)**, 2019–2023 — GPA **4.3/5.0 (Top 1%)**

I enjoy building practical tools. At **Baidu PaddlePaddle**, I worked on a Torch→Paddle auto-conversion toolchain validated on **300+** PyTorch models with **≈95%** line-level conversion.
