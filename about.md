Hi! I'm **Kaiwen Xia (夏凯文)**. My research focuses on **robust graph neural networks** and **trustworthy (multi-modal) large language models**, including LLM-for-Graph learning.  
I am currently an M.Eng. student at **NUDT** (2023-2026). Previously, I received my B.Eng. in **Data Science** from **Northeastern University**, graduating **Top 1%** with a GPA of **4.3/5.0**.

I enjoy building practical tools. At **Baidu PaddlePaddle**, I developed a Torch-Paddle auto-conversion toolchain validated on 300+ PyTorch models, achieving ~95% line-level conversion.

If you'd like to collaborate, please email me at <XiaKaiWenjoy@163.com>.
