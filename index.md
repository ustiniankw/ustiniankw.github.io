## Projects
- **LLM‑Enhanced Robust GNNs — ongoing research**  
  Curriculum‑driven defense framework that leverages LLMs to learn category‑neighborhood connectivity patterns; achieves stable topology under adversarial perturbations.
- **Torch ⇒ Paddle Auto‑Conversion Toolchain — Baidu PaddlePaddle**  
  Built and maintained a Torch→Paddle model conversion tool; validated on 300+ PyTorch models with ≈95% line‑level conversion, substantially reducing manual edits.
