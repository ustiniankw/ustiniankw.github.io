## Projects
- **LLM-Enhanced Robust GNNs — ongoing research** *(code in preparation)*  
  Training-free LLM–GNN cooperative defense that learns category–neighborhood connectivity patterns and iteratively refines graph structure under GNN performance supervision, leading to a semantically consistent and robust steady-state topology. Early results on Cora under 25% perturbation outperform vanilla GNN.
- **Torch ⇒ Paddle Auto-Conversion Toolchain — Baidu PaddlePaddle** [[GitHub](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaConvert)]  
  Contributed to PaddlePaddle; built and maintained a Torch→Paddle model conversion tool; validated on **300+** PyTorch models with **≈95%** line-level auto-conversion.
